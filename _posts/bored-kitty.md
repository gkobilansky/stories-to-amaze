Once upon a time, in a cozy yellow house on a peaceful street, there lived a cheerful family. Pete, the dad, was a brave firefighter who always came home with interesting stories of his day. Alina, the mom, was a talented singer who filled their home with music. They had three wonderful children: Cora, who was 12, Julianna, who was 7, and Butch, who was only two.

The family decided it was time to welcome a new pet into their hearts, so one sunny afternoon, they brought home a soft, fluffy kitten named Mia. Mia had bright eyes and a sweet little meow. From the moment she arrived, everyone fell in love with her. Cora liked to cuddle Mia while chatting about her school day. Julianna, who loved drawing pictures and learning new things, thought Mia would be the perfect companion. Little Butch clapped and giggled, pointing at Mia and calling, “Kitty! Kitty!”

Before long, however, they realized there was a tiny problem: No one quite knew how to play with Mia! Pete was busy at the fire station, Alina was busy practicing her songs, and Cora had homework to do in middle school. Seven-year-old Julianna was full of ideas, but she wasn’t sure exactly what Mia wanted. Mia tried to get everyone’s attention by weaving between their legs and giving little meows, but nobody noticed that she was bored.

When kitties get bored, they sometimes turn into mischief-makers! Mia started scratching the sofa and chasing after the curtains in Alina’s music room. She even knocked over a flower vase while leaping from the windowsill. “Mia!” Alina gasped, picking up the spilled flowers. “Why are you causing so much trouble?” But Mia wasn’t trying to be naughty—she just needed a fun way to play.

Julianna felt worried as she watched Mia dart around the house. She put on her thinking cap (something she liked to pretend she wore whenever she had a new idea) and remembered that her friend’s mom sold kitty toys on Amazon. “That’s it!” Julianna exclaimed. “Maybe Mia needs a special toy to chase.”

Julianna grabbed her tablet and searched for something that would catch Mia’s attention. Soon she found a colorful "[Flappy Bird Kitty Toy](https://amzn.to/4a2BfvJ)." The description said it fluttered and flapped on a string, just like a real bird. Julianna’s eyes lit up. “Mom! Dad!” she called out. “This is exactly what Mia needs!”

Alina paused her singing rehearsal to look at the screen. Pete peered over her shoulder. “Wow,” Pete said, smiling. “That looks like a real bird in flight!” Alina nodded and ordered the Flappy Bird Kitty Toy right away.

Early the next morning, the delivery person rang the doorbell. Julianna raced to the door with Cora and little Butch close behind. They opened the box together. There, sitting atop some tissue paper, was the bright, feathery [Flappy Bird](https://amzn.to/4a2BfvJ).

The moment Mia spotted the toy’s colorful wings, she crouched low and swished her tail back and forth in excitement. With a quick flick of her paw, she pounced on the bird, batting it gently before zooming off after it. Everyone giggled as Mia chased the toy around the living room, jumping higher than they ever thought she could.

Cora took a turn holding the string, delighting in Mia’s playful leaps. Julianna laughed, clapping her hands as she watched her kitten have the best time ever. Even two-year-old Butch squealed and clapped, toddling after Mia and the fluttery toy. And when Pete got home from the fire station, he joined the fun too, calling, “Let’s see if Mia can outrun a firefighter!”

Alina sang a happy tune, tapping her foot to the beat as she watched Mia zigzag around the room, no longer bored or mischievous. Now that Mia had something fun to do, she no longer scratched the sofa or knocked over decorations. Instead, she spent her time chasing her [Flappy Bird Kitty Toy](https://amzn.to/4a2BfvJ), purring loudly whenever one of her human family members played with her.

From that day forward, the house was filled with sweet sounds: Alina’s singing, Pete’s storytelling about heroic rescues, Cora’s laughter, Julianna’s excited chatter about new things she learned, and little Butch’s adorable giggles. And among all those happy noises was the gentle flutter of the Flappy Bird—plus the soft, contented purr of one very happy kitty named Mia. 

The End.
